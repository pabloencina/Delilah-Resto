This project proposes the creation of an online ordering system for a restaurant.

Starting  üöÄ
These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites üìã
Code Editor (Visual Studio Code or similar)
NodeJS
Express
DBeaver
MySQL
Postman

Installation üîß
Step 1:
Create a local folder to host the repository

Step 2:
Position yourself in the created folder and clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/pabloencina/acamica-delilah-resto

With this, you will have created the file structure and the content of the BackEnd of the application.

Step 3:
Run XAMPP and activate the MySQL Server. Then go to BDeaver.
    
Step 4:
In BDeaver create a Schena with the name "Delilah-resto".

Step 5:
In  BDeaver go to the menu: FILE> Open SQL Script and in the file selection window, navigate inside the local folder that you created, to the "./Delilah-resto-server / scriptsSQL-postman" folder.
Inside that folder choose the file "Create Delilah-resto Tables.sql".
Run that script in  BDeaver. With this you will have created the necessary tables to use in the API (always within the "Delilah-resto" schema.

Step 7:
Enter your Code editor (Visual Studio Code).
Open a terminal window and position yourself in the local folder that you created and within it in the "Delilah-resto" folder.
Type npm install. With that you will have installed all the necessary Dependencies.

Step 8:
Run node server.js. This will start up the server and you will be able to verify on the terminal screen that it has connected to the "Delilah-resto" Base.

Step 9:
Enter Postman and go to the menu and select FILE / IMPORT and click on the "Upload File:" button.
Navigate inside the local folder you created, and go to the folder "./delilah-resto-server / scriptsSQL-postman" and select the file "API Delilah-resto.postman_collection.json" "
This will create a collection in Postman with the name API Delilah-resto, where you can find different Requests to test the API.

Running the tests ‚öôÔ∏è
